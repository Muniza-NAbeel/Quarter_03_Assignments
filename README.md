# Quarter 03 Assignments â€“ OpenAI Agents SDK ðŸš€

Welcome to my **Quarter 03 Assignments** repository! ðŸŽ‰  
This repo is a collection of projects I built while learning the **OpenAI Agents SDK**.  

The main goal behind these assignments is to explore how **AI agents** can be developed, connected with APIs, and used to build **smart, real-world applications**. Each folder contains one assignment with its own setup and implementation.  

This `README.md` is a **general guide** for all assignments inside the repo.

## âš¡ Whatâ€™s Inside?

- Practical implementations using the **OpenAI Agents SDK** . 
- API integrations to bring agents closer to real-world use cases . 
- Experiments with different **design patterns** and **agent workflows**.  
- Beginner-friendly projects that gradually build up to more complex scenarios  .
- A step-by-step approach to learning agent development .
